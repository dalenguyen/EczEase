## Roadmap

This project involves developing a tech platform to support individuals with eczema and food allergies. The platform will include:

- **AI Chatbot**: Provides personalized advice and guidance on managing eczema, focusing on diet and lifestyle adjustments.
- **Symptom Tracking**: Users can log symptoms, food intake, and treatments to identify potential triggers and monitor progress.
- **Naturopath Directory**: A global directory of naturopathic practitioners specializing in skin conditions, allowing users to find local experts.
- **Educational Content**: Evidence-based articles and guides on eczema management, dietary interventions, and allergy awareness.
- **Community Support**: Forums for users to share experiences and receive support from peers and experts.

The goal is to empower users with actionable insights and resources to improve their condition while fostering a supportive community.
